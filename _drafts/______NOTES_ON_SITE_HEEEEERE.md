# Notes

- Test (near enough) locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- Still want to improve hosted look and feel
- And try diff themes
- And align local serve to it (scared to check it in too at present)
- Jekyll has already started collecting stuff, vaginteresting e.g. [../_site/img/IMG_0328.HEIC.jpg](../_site/img/IMG_0328.HEIC.jpg)
