# Notes

- LEDs / similar style posts
    - Flexbox
    - stand up Tailwind, 
    - Remix, "Spa mode", nodejs with jsx / react in it.
    - start with Nav, About / Projects / Music / Scuba vids
    - Proper markdown / SSG to do this magic, e.g. give it a list of youtube URLs and IMG files, and it tiles them, lightbox gallery as wellery. one day pre-processing (e.g. image res)
    - maybe helpful masonry / flexbox links:

        - couldn't find another example of someone's blog...

- Test (near enough) locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- Still want to improve hosted look and feel
- And try diff themes
- And align local serve to it (scared to check it in too at present)
- Jekyll has already started collecting stuff, interesting e.g. [../_site/img/IMG_0328.HEIC.jpg](../_site/img/IMG_0328.HEIC.jpg)
- Fix the damn manual garbage HTML on led page
    - do cool tiling, responsive, smart margins / paddington bears
    - thumbnail spacing all wrong
    - masonry?
    - i'd like the proper markdown / SSG to do this magic, i give it a list of youtube URLs and IMG files, and it tiles them, lightbox gallery as wellery.
- newer machine: `brew install ruby ; bundle install `, plus had to add to Gemfile
