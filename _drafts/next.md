## Blog Post Kind of ideas

- Live audio processing (have primarily stuck to only midi), Python specifically,
  tried some libs, PyAudio was my favorite, simple utils class, when run, basic pipe, reference below on audio piping general
- Audio "Piping" / snooping in general! Soundflower => Audio BlackHole
- Pedalboard realtime processing
- Bash escaping gotchas, and wow ChatGPT is great for this?
- YouTube easy timestamps + CC by .vtt file
- Zoom multistomp hacking
- Docker - for Jupyter notebooks
- TS types for event emitter, best practices? (idk them yet)
- `ddestroy`, one of my opus's!
