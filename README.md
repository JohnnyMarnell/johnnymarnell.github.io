# Johnny Marnell

Hey there, welcome to my super-WiP GitHub pages site.

I'm a lover of all things music and technology, and their intersection.
I have a ton of hack projects I'm starting to document here.

Professionally wise, I was most recently a Staff Engineer
at Spotify in the Advertising Business Unit.
