# Johnny Marnell

👋🏻 Hey friend, welcome to my super-WiP, barest of the bones 🦴
GitHub pages site.

🎵❤️🤖 I'm a lover of all things music and technology, and their intersection.
I have a ton of hack projects I've started documenting here,
thanks for taking a look!

👷🏻 Professionally wise, I most recently worked as a Staff Engineer
at Spotify in the Advertising Business Unit.

# Some Projects

## Ableton / DAWs / Music

- [**Ableton Live Realtime Diff**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mulwc2U11o8)
  Did you know Ableton Live Set (`.als`) files were just gzipped XML? ...you did? Well, quit your showboating. This hack surfaces realtime changes to the underlying file as you save

- [**Ableton Live HTTP REST API**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfeG9-BbLko)
  <span id="ableton-resticle">Prototype</span> of hacking a `SocketServer` into Ableton's undocumented, unofficial python subsystem and API, for external control (e.g. with a custom web UI)

- [**REAPER / Network control / API**](https://github.com/JohnnyMarnell/j5-reaper)
  Built a custom Node.JS API to control REAPER. Hacked with Lua and REAPER's
  proprietary EEL script to successfully get a TCP server with
  ring buffer read/write working. Have sinced moved to custom API backed
  by OSC mappings (need to push). That's allowed me to build my Raspberry
  Pi looper [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKP3OBteXtg)

- [**Gartrex 9000 Raspberry Pi Mobile Jam Loop Staishe**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKP3OBteXtg)
  Custom Node.JS looper, quantizer, swing, arranger. Headless REAPER.
  Custom compiled low latency Linux kernel.

  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKP3OBteXtg). Have taken this everywhere

## More Audio Hacks

- [**10k+ LED Art installation**](/led-art.html)
  Java, Chromatik / LX Studio, Raspberry Pi plus Node.JS UI and python ML beat syncing

- [**Beat Detective**](/beat-detective.md)
  Live beat and tempo detection and synchronizing using python music ML Librosa powered predictions. ([Jupyter notebook](./jupyter/tempo.html), quick [demo vid](https://youtu.be/wihCkwniqwU), plus see it live [here](/led-art.html)

- Coming Soon: My custom Raspberry Pi looper performance rig

- [**Bass Bounce Visualization**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0XzIzDG8k0)
  Built automatic audio reactive visualization based on FFT analyzed dynamic signals,
  Java with LX Studio. You can see the bounce start and stop depending on bass thumps

- [**Spotify Quarantine Halloween**](https://www.instagram.com/p/CG-u44ElvNk11U1LTU6wTNDM25x7Km-Vq7ns6o0)
  My band plus some teammates made a silly _"Hungry Like the Wolf"_ video
  for a company-wide Halloween themed quarantine live stream.
  Solely using Spotify's [SoundTrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/),
  a DAW that runs everywhere (even in the browser)

- [**Delay FX plugin - Spotify Hack Day**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJnJ6o7nmA4)
  Adding tempo sync'd note division to Delay FX, previously limited to only explicit time / milliseconds
  specifying

- [**MIDI Guitar**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNkmwI8Ubqs)
  I own both the [Jamstik Studio](https://jamstik.com/) guitar and the [Fishman TriplePlay](https://www.fishman.com/tripleplay/) pickup. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNkmwI8Ubqs)
  is a zany quick one experimenting with the latter plus a fun orchestral patch that varies instruments depending on velocity and note range (e.g. timpani hit accents added when loud, different horn sections at higher registers). (...It was height of quarantine, please excuse the Snap filter cat lasers 😂).

- Coming Soon: Intelligent live use of MIDI guitar

- Coming Soon (I hope 🤞🏻): Massive backlog
